# Deliverable 3

## Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this election audit analysis is to use Python to help read through compiled data files to help determine voter turnout and other statistics using mathematical operations via code and to write new files so that it could be easier to automate future files instead of using Excel.  

## Election-Audit Results:

## Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

One way the script can be modified is changing the read file name from the current excel/data file to a new one, so if there was a similar election recorded in a separate file, the script can be modified to read that new excel/data file and still be used to find the winner of the election.

Another way is that if the election was done on a bigger scale, such as a state election instead of a county, the script can be easily modified to hold the state results in place of the county results.
